##  Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility 

Summary: All humans are equal, we need to design a society which reflects this.


Look at the evidence - white men clearly built modern western society to heavily benefit them.


Interesting example: look at how humans attempt to attract a partner - women wear makup, have a wide variety of fancy clothes, aggressive beauty and standards, etc.
Men can get away with wearing a T shirt most days, there is no makeup or skincare routine, most keep their hair short which is more practical, and they can get away with being overweight

If humans followed a more natual order, imagine a future in which men wore bright outfits, lots of makeup, and competed for women's attention. 
Women would chose what they deemed the best, and would probably have a variety of sexual partners but primarily raise children with other women in manner similar to the dynamics of Orcas. They would only "settle down" with a male if they were extremely exceptional and the female of species considers it a worthy trade off.


People have gotten out of control with gender, sexual orientation, etc. The syndicate's approach comes from a place of priviliage. Everyone is welcome to join regardless of any differentiators but you have to meet the standards.

We treat each person as a human and strive to find different viewpoints to join the syndicate and improve our resilience. We don't track gender, race, sexual orientation, or anything similar and our goal is not to find diversity accross those classifications. Our goal is find diversity of backgrounds and experiences.

We envision a future in which humans stop i
For example: bathrooms based on gender are stupid - everyone should void themselves of waste in shared facilities.

Our unique model applies the principles of horizontal and vertical scaling as well as other principles from technology to the corporate infrastructure. Therefore, this is the founder's blog for the Barbarians Chapter. Each Chapter will have a leader with a unique vision and as long as they don't conflict with the organization-wide framework, they are completely free to unilaterally make decisions within their Chapter. This creates a highly distributed organizational structure, allowing organic growth with a strong supporting network.

As the organization grows, other divergent architectural decisions will become more apparent. The hypothesis is that this will be helpful in recruiting new members and assisting others in copying whatever parts they find useful.

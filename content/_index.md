Organizations are a human construct which will grow and evolve over time in positive or negative directions. We believe it is possible to align incentives and use tenets and processes to steer in a positive direction. A strong foundation is necessary to accomplish this, since many organizations start off in a positive direction and lose their way over time.

This is a human-centric organization and we are only as strong as the people who comprise the organization. We are trying to seek out talented individuals and the goal is to create a strong community.

This isn’t an organization for just anyone, because we believe in high standards. However, the organization’s core tenets establish the broad limits that leave freadom to experiment, explore models, and even openly contradict each other.

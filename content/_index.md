Organizations are a human construct and will grow and evolve over time however this growth can either be positive or negative. We believe it is possible to align incentives and use tenets and processes to steer our direction to a positive direction. A strong foundation is necessary to accomplish this, since many organizations start off in a positive direction and lose their way over time.

This is a human-centric organization and we are only as strong as the people who comprise the organization. We are trying to seek out talented individuals and incorporate as many diverse backgrounds as possible because diversity breeds resilience and the goal is to create unique chapters within our organization which naturally grow, split, shrink, or die.

This isn’t an organization for just anyone, because we believe in high standards. However, the organization’s core tenets establish the broad left and right limits so as long as chapters operate within these, they are free to experiment, explore models, and even openly contradict each other.

"_Once you stop learning, you start dying_"

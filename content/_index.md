Inspired by Cap Troopers of sci-fi, we deploy elite teams to drop into environments, quickly analyzing issues and delivering results. Our primary focus is providing digital services but we also offer other services as long as they align to our overall goal of building organization’s internal capacity and helping them become independent in how they solve organizational and business problems. Eschewing many normalized practices, we encourage rebellious and divergent thinking to boldly experiment and discover further innovations.

While admittedly there are thousands of companies who do similar work, most of them have a capitalist corporate model which is fundamentally mis-aligned with their customer’s organizational objectives. While our company still operates as a for-profit entity within the corporate world, our internal incentive structures and model are fundamentally different to ensure the DNA of the organization is truly aligned with the mission values.

To this end, we are formed as a benefit corporation and use an egalitarian approach to organizing which also significantly reduces overhead costs, resulting in higher quality talent at very competitive rates. Our goal is to pioneer a highly disruptive approach which properly incentivizes the team to remain mission focused over time.

Our model is extensible so we are interested in co-founders but also happy to keep people in the loop who might be interested in joining in the future. We seek to continue experimenting, optimizing, and evolving because

Strategically investing in a brighter future
{{< /lead >}}

The company is currently in a holding pattern while we investigate and resolve issues of member malfeasance resulting from a member lying to the partners about intentions and failing to fulfill their fiduciary responsibility to the firm. 

On a positive note, this is a great pressure test of the structure and operating agreement. Once we complete the process of removing them, we will be excited to start the next chapter.

*Sincerely,*

*Bennett <br>*
*Founder and General Partner*

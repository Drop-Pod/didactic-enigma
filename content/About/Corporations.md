## A Cancer of Modern Society


 Ayn Rand saw the government as an evil force but people are the root of all evil. Systems are designed to benefit people and if it isn't clear to you who 

 Incentives - trace the paths

 corporations grow large enough, they truely are a seperate entity

 this is highly dangerous because this entity is a literal cancer - it only seeks to make itself larger and more powerful and has no consideration of the larger system

 Cancer will keep growing even though it will kill it's host

 Corporations will keep growing even as they kill the planet that hosts them or the people that they depend on.
 
 Problems:
 Too big to fail
 Too big to regulate
 Too big to properly repres
 
 I am an anti-capitalist in a certain way see the concept of working for someone and helping them make millions exactly the same type of exploitation that she was ranting against. I am also an anti-communist and I believe that trusting a party or group of people to act in the best interests of a larger group has also been demonstrated to fail repeatedly.

 Instead, I believe the answer is an intentionally limited organization which directly represents the members interests. The syndicate treats every member equally and seeks to maintain and grow assets for the members. Internally, it functions with many principles that people might associate with socialism but externally it functions more aligned to capitalist principles, seeking to preserve wealth and protect the syndicateâ€™s interests.

 No system is perfect but if the sizes are limited, true representational governance can be accomplished and the syndicate will never grow unstainably or be so big that it cannot be regulated, become too big to fail, or any of the other problems.

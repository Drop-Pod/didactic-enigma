## Confidently blazing a trail

> You can’t make decisions based on fear and the possibility of what might happen. 
– Michelle Obama  
  
Here is how I spend most of my time and potential areas of engagement or partnership:

1. Actively investing in stocks, equities, and real estate and always interested in new opportunities. My goal is to create ethical passive sources of income to reduce the risk of active ventures.

2. Drop Pod Limited is my unique approach to professional services. It is a SDVOSB and HUBZone small business focused on a non-exploitative worker's cooperative approach to delivering technology in the public sector (currently not engaged in the federal sector due to conflicts of interest)
Interested in advisors, board members, co-founders, and future employees.
   
3. Single and open to a variety of dynamics - if you are interested in dating or a platonic friendship, I have a detailed “Read Me” file which can be shared for further review and consideration.

If you are interested in any of these email me ( my name at the domain)

## Confidently blazing a trail

> You can’t make decisions based on fear and the possibility of what might happen. 
– Michelle Obama  
  
I plan to update this soon with a more of a detailed biography but here is the quick summary of how I spend most of my time and potential areas of engagement or partnership:

1. Very successful public sector career, culminating in my current role as a supervisor for the [White House Presidential Innovation Fellowship Program](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/). I deeply believe in the value of public service and improving the government to equitably serve everyone. While I am proud of my work in the public sector, all views on this website are my own, so no further further detail will be provided to avoid the implication of an endorsement. 
   
2. Working on launching a distillery - locally owned, planning to make it a worker's cooperative. Looking for future customers, co-founders, or future owners/employees. Updates available [here](https://redchairdistillery.beehiiv.com/subscribe).
   
3. Single and open to a variety of dynamics - if you are interested in dating or a platonic partnership, I have a full “Read Me” file which can be shared for further review and consideration.
   
4. Actively investing in real estate and always interested in new opportunities. Also exploring housing cooperatives, tiny houses, communes, and other ways to live more sustainably in community.
Looking for thought partners, co-founders, or just lessons learned.
   
5. Founder of a SDVOSB and HUBZone small business focused on a non-exploitative worker's cooperative approach to delivering technology in the public sector (currently not engaged in the federal sector due to conflicts of interest)
Interested in advisors, board members, co-founders, and future employees.

## Confidently blazing a trail

I plan to update this with a detailed biography but the quick summary is as follows:

1. Very successful public sector career, currently a supervisor for the [White House Presidential Innovation Fellowship Program](https://presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) and deeply believe
in the value of public service and improving the government to equitably serve everyone. I am proud of my work in the public sector but all views on this website are my own,
so no further mention of my position will be made to avoid implication of an endorsement.
   
2. Working on launching a distillery - locally owned, planning to make it a worker's cooperative - looking for future customers, co-founders, or future owners/employees
   
3. Single and looking for a life partner - if you are interested, I have a full "[date me](https://www.wired.com/story/date-me-google-docs-and-the-hyper-optimized-quest-for-love/)" document that I will send you.
   
4. Actively investing in real estate and always interested in new opportunities. Also exploring housing cooperatives, tiny houses, communes, and other ways to live more sustainably in community.
Looking for thought partners, co-founders, or just lessons learned.
   
5. Founder of a SDVOSB and HUBZone small business focused on a non-exploitative worker's cooperative approach to delivering technology in the public sector (currently not engaged in the federal sector due to conflicts of interest)
Interested in advisors, board members, co-founders, and future employees.

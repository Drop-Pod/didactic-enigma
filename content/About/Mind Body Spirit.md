## Three Sides of the Triangle

Finally explaining the logo!

triangle = mind body spirit

We have standards for all 3

**Body**
Physical shape

Tattoo?

**Mind**
Must educate yourself, challenge assumptions
Mastery of emotions: fear is the mind killer?


**Spirit**: 
what is spiritual fitness?
How well you regulate emotions? (Fear is the mind killer)


beliefs in higher powers, spirits, planes of existince, - anything you want is supported as long as it doesn't contradict science.
"I can do all things through evidence 

examples: you must renounce beliefs in astrology, homeopathy, healing crystals

You can be a member of organized religion but cannot under any circumstances give them money. No exceptions, you will be immedietly cast out for this. Spiritual matters must preserve a clear seperation from physical and its an easy test for any religion to see what they actually want from you.

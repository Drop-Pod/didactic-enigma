The firm is an SDVOSB and HUBZone small business focused on a non-exploitative worker's cooperative approach to delivering technology in the public sector (currently not engaged in the federal sector due to conflicts of interest). The goal is to limit growth and truly invest in people to make the world a better place.
Currently interested in advisors, board members, co-founders, and future employees.

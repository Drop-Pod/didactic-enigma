Vision of the future

The founder, Bennett Gebken, is one of those people who constantly blazes a trail and rebels against the status quo. In spite of a life filled with several challenges and immense adversity at times, he also had the privilege of being born a white man which really helped him overcome everything and remain standing. However, rather than seeking to act only in his self interest, he has chosen to devote his life in service of others.

These articles will outline the philosophy, structure, and strategy behind the syndicate. It is hard to explain exactly how we operate on a tactical level without significant amounts of context.

If you feel comfortable with the concepts and wish to discuss the possibility of joining, please email "bennett" or "corporate" at our domain (intentionally not spelling it out since the bots spam it enough as is).

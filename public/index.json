I had one of those moments but admit that imagining the future is extremely challenging. Every potential future exists at odds with all other possible paths. When we choose a future, we are destroying numerous other potential paths and the more we focus on a long term goal, the more closed off we become to other increasingly divergent paths which could be a potential.\nI am pondering this as I am excited to explore another new idea and yet another potential path. Beginnings and starting things are always incredible but sustaining that momentum through adversity is an ongoing challenge for me. I get easily distracted and move on to other projects, especially since I remain fairly detached from all my projects. No matter how enamored I am with a project or idea, there remains a willingness to kill it and start over when presented with a better alternative. To that end, I have sought to take a more holistic approach to pursuits so that the structure remains consistent even as the winds of change blow and projects rise and fall.\nTo this end, I have started consolidating all my ideas under Drop Pod as a long term approach to building a scalable solution that will let me tackle many of the challenges that I see in the world. During my 20’s, I spent a significant amount of time apologizing for being smart and successful - but that era has come to an end. I am proud of who I am and the fact that I think differently than most people. My neurodivergent mindset has been an asset to me in business and I want to expand my success to others so that we can use our collective influence towards improving society and hopefully make the world a better place.\n“I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another person, nor ask another person to live for mine.”\nI believe intensely in the importance of independence and the ability to shape our own destiny. Humans also naturally seek to live in communities but our modern society applies pressure against what is natural in order to maximize profit. I often fantasize about just building a small shack in the woods and leaving everything behind but don’t believe this is the answer because while I love solitude, too much of anything isn’t healthy. Instead, I think it is possible to clearly communicate covenants, build an intentional community, and establish a clan of amazing humans.\nThere will be homework assignments!\n~ Bennett\n","date":"15 July 2023","permalink":"/posts/sparks/","section":"Chasing Fireflies","summary":"Glimpses of the Future #\rSometimes we experience moments in which we pierce the veil of our current reality and we can suddenly see a potential future path.","title":"Sparks"},{"content":"Confidently blazing a trail #\rYou can’t make decisions based on fear and the possibility of what might happen. – Michelle Obama\nHere is how I spend most of my time and potential areas of engagement or partnership:\nActively investing in stocks, equities, and real estate and always interested in new opportunities.

Many people complain about inflation but fail to realize that high inflation is often being caused by private companies raising consumer prices to boost their profits. The average S\u0026amp;P 500 CEO made $15.5 million in 2020, 299 times the pay of the median worker and this winner-take-all philosophy continues to increase inequality and makes careers a zero sum game in which everyone else must lose, so that corporations can continue to grow exponentially.\nThere is a thought experiment proposed by Brad Stollery:\nSuppose you\u0026rsquo;re one of five people who have been selected by a mysterious philanthropist to participate in a contest. The five of you all have comparable debt-levels and costs-of-living, as well as similar, middle-class financial situations. You\u0026rsquo;re all roughly the same age, equally healthy, have the same number of children, and you all live moderately low-risk lifestyles. Privately, and one by one, a representative of the donor approaches each of you with a blank check and a pen, and poses the following question: How much money would you have to be paid, right here and now, to retire today and never receive another dollar of income (from any source) for the rest of your life? The catch this time is that whoever among the five players writes the lowest amount on the check will be paid that sum. The other four players will get nothing.\nThis leads us to the critical question: How much is enough? The answer is complicated, especially since in reality we all have different financial situations, privilege, future earning potential and many other factors which mean that people will have widely different answers. However, I believe it is possible to set upper limits which everyone can agree upon. For example, someone with 10 years of experience who bills at $100 an hour could be fairly paid twice as much as a junior team member who bills at $50 hourly rate. However, it is pretty hard to make a coherent argument why certain members of leadership deserve a 10x, 100x, or greater compensation.\nThis thought line dovetails with a minimalist mindset and really challenges the consumer culture which Americans live in. Here I think it is important to acknowledge that discussions around minimalism quickly highlight that it is a problem as a result of the immense privilege and wealth which people in developed countries have. Extreme minimalism is not for everyone and it is debatable how healthy some of the techniques taken are but basic ideas regarding setting limits on consumption are important to developing a sustainable society.\nIn parallel, working in the public sector shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be motivated by the pursuit of maximizing personal wealth because every dollar spent is taxpayer revenue. Just as civil servants are told they are stewards of these funds and must be fiscally responsible, those who seek government contracts as a primary revenue stream should seek to develop sustainable models which minimize unnecessary costs.\nHere are some concrete steps which should help the organization shift from ideals into action:\nSalary Transparency - Sharing all salaries and setting a hard 3x total compensation limit for all positions. Carbon Neutrality - offsetting the organization’s carbon emissions but also each employee’s personal carbon footprint with prizes people’s choices resulting in reductions. Charity - Ranked choice voting to select a manageable number of charities to donate to each year. Collective Bargaining by default Instead of promising wild growth and amazing returns to shareholders, we want to establish a collective of amazing people who do great work and will also be our primary investors. From the investment perspective, we aim to pay modest quarterly dividends on our stock so that it is a reliable source of retirement income for those no longer working. Understanding that we may need to adjust over time based on inflation but our goal isn’t to have a share price which continues to go up exponentially or is traded for short term gains.\nFor our customers, this means that we aren’t always trying to raise rates or sell more products. Our prices might increase with inflation but our goal is to provide fair rates with transparency regarding costs and pricing. Such as using a Cost Plus approach to pricing work further in the future.\nThese ideas are a work in-progress, the goal is to build it in the open, welcoming feedback and ideas to improve it. Hopefully this will result in pioneering a sustainable business model which challenges assumptions and others can be inspired to iterate on.\n","date":"9 May 2023","permalink":"/posts/enough/","section":"Chasing Fireflies","summary":"According to data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), corporate profits continue to set new records in comparison to pre-pandemic.","title":"Enough"},{"content":"Figuring out where to start is challenging. There are multiple threads, shifting patterns, and influences which shift over time. There are often quiet sounds which get drowned out in the noise of life but important truths we rediscover later. Language is an imperfect tool, bold statements often belie the complexity and nuance of circumstances.\nRather than agonize over the best manner to frame these ideas and thoughts, we are going to send ourselves flying into the unknown. Blazing a new trail and hopefully developing increased clarity over time.\nBreak the wheel #\rThere is a constant cycle of growth in the corporate world which mirrors the organic world in many ways. In the book, Barbarians to Bureaucrats, the organizational leadership cycle is described as follows:\nProphet \u0026gt; Barbarian \u0026gt; Builder \u0026amp; Explorer | | Administrator \u0026gt; Bureaucrats \u0026gt; Aristocrat\nAs you can see the first half is a positive increase in principles and process but the second half disintegrates into excessive rules, procedures, and processes which stifle creativity and put the organization into a death spiral. That sounds dramatic but analyzed over a long enough period of time - what organization has avoided this slow downward spiral? Most large corporations leverage their position to buy smaller companies which injects a temporary boost of innovation and creativity into the behemoth.\nSo in founding this organization, the goal is to break out of the cycle and escape at the peak of the cycle and maintain synergy going forward. I believe there is no shortcut or easy path, but accomplishing this requires doing hard work and making very difficult sacrifices. These ideals will be examined in more detail in future posts but they all center around limiting the accumulation of power, wealth, and influence within the organization. For example, rather than offering complicated compensation plans, salary will be negotiated transparently and shared openly. There will also be a hard limit on the total compensation that any individual may receive. Everyone can\u0026rsquo;t be paid the exact same amount, but everyone should see a path to obtaining the maximum pay, if they desire to put in the work.\nThe desired end state is an egalitarian organization with a non-hierarchical power structure that embraces unique individuals and uses worker cooperative dynamics to ensure that everyone has a real voice in the future of the organization.\nMission #\rDrop Pod is a boutique technology services firm focused on the public sector. Inspired by Cap Troopers of sci-fi, we drop into new environments to neutralize problems, stabilize environments, and achieve results.\nWhile admittedly there are thousands of companies who do similar work, our goal is to use a fundamentally different incentive structure which we believe will better support the government over the long term. Our goal is to help the government reduce reliance on external support and rebuild internal expertise and capacity so that it can work better for everyone.\nAs a Benefit Corporation, we can do this even though it will reduce future profits and direct shareholder value because the firm is a tool for social good focused on the mission of delivering value in a sustainable manner.\nWe must be the change we seek in the world. All business ought to be conducted as if people and place mattered. Through products, practices, and profits, businesses should aspire to do no harm and benefit all. To do so requires that we act with the understanding that we are each dependent upon another and thus responsible for each other and future generations. These types of ideals can often degrade into shiny marketing materials without tangible facts backing them up (for example, a corporation which claims to genuinely care about employees but also hires aggressively and then lays off 10% of staff). We will need to constantly look for those moments to prove that these words aren\u0026rsquo;t hollow promises. It will be an ongoing cycle to establish and update mechanisms to prevent erosion of ideals and measures to hold the organization accountable over time.\n","date":"1 May 2021","permalink":"/posts/launch/","section":"Chasing Fireflies","summary":"Figuring out where to start is challenging.","title":"New Beginnings"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
